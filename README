papertimer 0.0.1 -- Simple full-screen countdown timer
Copyright (C) 2009 Christoph Sommer <mail@christoph-sommer.de>

Uses python and Tkinter to display a simple full-screen countdown timer
for session chairs and presentations. Run as follows:

./papertimer.py

When running, papertimer is controlled using the keyboard:

Spacebar
	pauses and continues the countdown
Escape
	quits papertimer
+ or Up
	adds time (default: 1 minute)
- or Down
	subtracts time (default: 1 minute)
Enter
	sets time (default: 30 minutes)
Number keys and "s" key
	can be used to change the increment/decrement or the time to set
	in minutes or (with "s" appended) in seconds. So, to add thirty
	seconds to the speaker's time, you'd type "30s" and press "+".
	Or, to re-set the countdown to 25 minutes, you'd type "25" and 
	press Enter.
